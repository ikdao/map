# IKDAO Map App â€“ Interactive Mapping and Navigational Map
A Simple, Secure, Serving Map App alternative to many popular map services [https://map.ikdao,.org](https://map.ikdao.org)

## About the App
The IKDAO Map App is a web-based mapping application built using Leaflet.js, a powerful and lightweight JavaScript library for interactive maps. This app allows users to explore geographic locations, search places in real time, retrieve geolocation, and interact with objects on the map (such as buildings, rivers, and parks) to view their details.

## Features
- Interactive Map â€“ Users can pan and zoom through the map.

- Search Box â€“ Allows users to search for locations in real time by typing at least three letters.

- Geolocation Button â€“ Detects and centers the user's location on the map.

- Toggle Focus Button â€“ Lets users toggle between focusing on the map and scrolling the webpage.

- Reverse Geocoding â€“ Clicking on any place fetches detailed information about that location.

- Multiple Map Views â€“ Users can switch between different map layers (e.g., satellite, terrain, etc.).

## How to Use the App
- Explore the Map â€“ Click and drag to move around; zoom in and out using your mouse or touch gestures.
